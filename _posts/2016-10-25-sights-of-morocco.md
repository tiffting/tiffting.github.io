Most of what I got to see in Morocco involved the Sahara Desert, but I also spent a couple of days by the ocean in [Essaouira][essaouira] and a few days inland in Marrakesh. I have mixed feelings about this country: if you think America is racist and sexist, you might be thankful that you don't live in Morocco after you visit. But it is also a very different place if you're looking to get away from the familiar.

This post is a little bit different because I visited many of these places as part of a tour. Enjoy the photos more so than the details of each place!
