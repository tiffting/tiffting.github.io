Being the capital of [Thuringia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuringia), [Erfurt][erfurt] has unique features about it, such as its surprisingly intact medieval old town and its status as an important trading town at the junction between France and Russia and between Northern Germany and Italy.

## Anger

[99084 Erfurt, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/cNaL5qPg5B22)

You can feel the city's energy in the [Anger](http://www.erfurt-tourismus.de/en/all-about-erfurt/shopping/anger/). Many people cross the square every day, and you can see historic architecture while doing some shopping.

## Angerbrunnen

[Neuwerkstraße, 99084 Erfurt, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/nquAMk8PBYT2)

This fountain on the west end of the [Anger][anger] caught my attention because someone had placed a fresh rose in the hand of one of the statues.

## Erfurt Cathedral

[Domstufen 1, 99084 Erfurt, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/88gbhgpDeXB2)

Home of the largest medieval bell in the world, [Erfurt Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erfurt_Cathedral) sits on a hillside.

The front door's knocker seems a bit Asian to me.

My favorite part about the church is the stained glass windows. Each one tells a different story.

## Erinnerungsort Topf & Söhne

[Sorbenweg 7, 99099 Erfurt, Germany](https://maps.google.com/?q=Erinnerungsort%20Topf%20%26%20S%C3%B6hne%20%E2%80%93%20Die%20Ofenbauer%20von%20Auschwitz%2C%20Sorbenweg%207%2C%2099099%20Erfurt%2C%20Germany&ftid=0x47a472b600897c05:0xfb900ce582516ce4&hl=en-US&gl=us)

A grim history awaits you at [Topf & Söhne](http://www.topfundsoehne.de/cms-www/index.php?id=75&l=1): it's where the furnaces used at Auschwitz were manufactured.

Out front, you can see a model of what the area used to look like when furnace-production was in full swing.

### Admission and hours

Admission is free, and exhibits are open to visitors Tuesdays-Sundays from 10:00-18:00.

### Getting there and back

The site is located about 20 minutes southeast of city center if you go on foot.

## Krämerbrücke

[99084 Erfurt, Germany](https://maps.google.com/?q=Kr%C3%A4merbr%C3%BCcke%2C%2025%2C%2C%20Kr%C3%A4merbr%C3%BCcke%2024%2C%2099084%20Erfurt%2C%20Germany&ftid=0x47a472961e4faf01:0xf7de10972f703389&hl=en-US&gl=us)

The medieval [Merchant's Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krämerbrücke) is still inhabited today, which is remarkable. It's lined with half-timbered houses on both sides and doesn't even feel like a bridge while you're walking across it. Only when you look at it from the outside can you tell that it sits on a river.

## Zitadelle Petersberg

[99084 Erfurt, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/Khub4mgcFin)

This fort gives you a good view of the city and is just northwest of [Erfurt Cathedral][erfurt-cathedral].

While I was visiting [Erfurt][erfurt], their Oktoberfest was going on, and the fort was a great place to watch the ferris wheel spinning around in the Domplatz.

### Admission and hours

From what I could tell, you can walk in anytime without worrying about admission, but if you want to go on a guided tour, you'll have to book one through the [Erfurt Tourist Office](http://www.erfurt-tourismus.de/en/guided-tours-and-sightseeing-trips/).
