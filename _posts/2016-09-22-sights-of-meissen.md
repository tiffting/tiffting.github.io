The castle of [Meißen][meissen] is the oldest in Saxony and makes it look like a storybook town. It's also known for having the first porcelain manufacturer (established in 1710) in Europe.

## Albrechtsburg and Hochstift Dom

[Domplatz 1, 01662 Meißen, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/swEPfxYgdG92)

[Albechtsburg](https://www.albrechtsburg-meissen.de/en/) is where the Dukes of Saxony lived before they moved to Dresden.

It's absolutely beautiful from the outside. When I visited, there was also a ferris wheel set up for the upcoming wine festival.

It's takes less than ten minutes to walk there from the center of town. You can even opt to walk the historic circuit, which has a great view of the surrounding area.

## Markt

[Markt, 01662 Meißen, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/iLAM2rZ3j2m)

I hadn't seen a maypole in a long time, but the Markt had one! The architecture there is quite charming, so it's worth hanging out there.

The [Frauenkirsche](https://www.frauenkirche-meissen.de/) is also located there. Check out its little white bells in the tower.

### Admission and hours

No one is taking tickets to chill in Marktplatz. Or closing it down.

### Getting there and back

It's in center of the city and in a flat area. Walk there!

## Porzellanmuseum

[Talstraße 9, 01662 Meißen, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/CfWbm8yguBL2)

I was on the fence about going to [this museum](http://www.meissen.com/en) because I'd left my jacket behind, but the sun came out mid-afternoon. To show you the way, the street is marked with the museum's logo: crossed swords. I didn't actually visit the exhibit, but I browsed the shop, which is quite expensive. There's also a cafe inside where you can eat and drink off of dishware manufactured there.

If you feel like it, check out the museum exhibition to get an explanation for the porcelain-making process. It costs €9 for adults and €5 for kids. Also available is the combo ticket with [the castle][castle], which is €14 for adults or €7 reduced.
