I've been heads down traveling around and not making the time to write while doing so. But I want to make sure that I'm delivering quality content and not just more digital garbage. For my last few months of my one year trip, please enjoy some short pieces on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tifftingcom/). Until July 13, 2017, I'll be working on my 100 Day Project of translated sketches. We'll see what I do with my account after that.

A quick update on where I am: I flew from Seoul, South Korea, and landed in Vancouver, Canada, yesterday morning, and I'm recovering well from jet lag. It's a bit of a relief to be in a country where I can walk down the street and frequently overhear English being spoken. I still plan to learn some French (hopefully using resources that teach the Canadian version) in anticipation of the latter part of my two-month stay in Canada.

It's hilarious how nosy my Canadian customs officer was. No other country out of the 20+ that I've been to on this trip has been so thorough in their interrogation. The following is an approximate transcript of our conversation:

> **Officer:** Why are you in Canada?

> **Me:** To visit.

> **Officer:** Visit what?

> **Me:** Family & friends, national parks.

> **Officer:** What do you do for work?

> **Me:** I'm self-employed.

> **Officer:** Year, but what kind of work?

> **Me:** Software.

> **Officer:** Do you work for a company?

> **Me:** I freelance.

> **Officer:** How long are you going to be in Canada?

> **Me:** Two months.

> **Officer:** Why are you going to be here for so long?

> **Me:** I haven't been to Canada in a long time.

> **Officer:** When was the last time you were here?

> **Me:** Maybe 12?

If Canada doesn't want Americans to tour their country for so long, why allow Americans to enter on an automatic tourist visa for [180 days](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/canada.html)? Perhaps she was concerned that I would seek political asylum.
