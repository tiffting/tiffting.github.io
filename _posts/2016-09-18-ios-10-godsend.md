I just have to say that a benefit that probably wasn't advertised about [iOS 10](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-10/) is that photos now follow the [original camera file system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_rule_for_Camera_File_system) when uploaded, rather than all being called "image.jpeg". And why does this matter?

Well, now I no longer have to individually save each photo I run through [TinyJPG](https://tinyjpg.com/) when [handling blog images](/handling-blog-images)! (I was finding it hard to keep track of which optimized photos I'd already downloaded when I uploaded a large number of them, so I was uploading and downloading in six-photo batches. :sob:)

Instead, I can upload all the photos I want to optimize, wait for [TinyJPG][tinyjpg] to do its thing, and hit the "download all" button. This creates a zip file that I can open in [iZip](https://appsto.re/us/dolRy.i) and extract all photos into my camera roll. Hallelujah! :raised_hands:
