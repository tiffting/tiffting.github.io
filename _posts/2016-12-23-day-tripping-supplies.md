This post covers a special request topic from Aja who wonders, "What do you take with you when you are out for the day? You seem pretty minimalistic, and it would be an interesting insight to how you actually travel."

Whether I'm out for an hour or eight, I pretty much carry the same stuff every day. Check out this comprehensive list of what I bring with me.

## In my purse
