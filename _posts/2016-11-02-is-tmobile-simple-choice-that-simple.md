If you have an unlocked [GSM][gsm] phone, you can easily avoid buying and carrying around a bunch of SIM cards with you especially if you're traveling to a bunch of different countries by subscribing to any [T-Mobile Simple Choice plan][tmobile-plans]. They include unlimited data and SMS, and phone calls are 20 cents per minute. (I use my [Google Voice][google-voice] number to get around that.) Check out the [full list of supported countries][tmobile-countries], but I'm going to be keeping a running tally of how well the service really performs in each city I visit.

## Australia

[Telstra][telstra-au] was the [3G][3g] provider in the cities of Australia, but much like [New Zealand](#new-zealand), if you're driving between cities, you may or may not stay connected. Notably, [Lady Elliot Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Elliot_Island) has no connectivity whatsoever. (2016-12-05)

![Almost summertime in Sydney]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/australia-sydney.png)

## Austria

### Vienna

[T-Mobile A][tmobile-a] connects at [LTE][lte], but since 2016-09-01, my speeds have been throttled at [EDGE][edge] since faster international roaming speeds were offered as part of a temporary promotion for the summer Olympics. (2016-09-05)

![Viennese summer weather]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/austria-vienna.png)

## Czech Republic

### Brno

[T-Mobile CZ][tmobile-cz] usually connected at [LTE][lte] with an occasional drop to [3G][3g] or [EDGE][edge], but there were never any dead spots. Again, my speeds were throttled at the [EDGE][edge] rate anyway. (2016-09-09)

![Starting to get into chillier climes]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/czechrepublic-brno.jpeg)

### Ceske Budejovice

I never noticed my connection with [T-Mobile CZ][tmobile-cz] dropping completely: it was mostly on [LTE][lte] with an occasional switch to [3G][3g]. Towards the end of my stay in [Olomouc](#olomouc), I switched to the [T-Mobile One+][tmobile-one] plan, which doubles international data roaming speeds for $25/mo. (2016-09-18)

![Nice weather in the CR]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/czechrepublic-ceskebudejovice.png)

### Cesky Krumlov

In this touristy UNESCO town, [T-Mobile CZ][tmobile-cz] stayed steady at [LTE][lte]. Towards the end of my stay in [Olomouc](#olomouc), I switched to the [T-Mobile One+][tmobile-one] plan, which doubles international data roaming speeds for $25/mo. (2016-09-16)

![Steady as she goes]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/czechrepublic-ceskykrumlov.png)

### Olomouc

Although I've been relegated to [EDGE][edge] speeds, the service that [T-Mobile CZ][tmobile-cz] provided here felt slightly faster for some reason. Maybe I'm delusional now from having to use it for over a week. I never noticed my [LTE][lte] connection ever downgrading in this little university town. (2016-09-11)

![Still warm during the day]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/czechrepublic-olomouc.jpeg)

## Croatia

### Klis

The connection was spotty, but I could occasionally get [3G][3g] service from [T-Mobile HR][tmobile-hr]. (2016-08-23)

### Split

You can get relatively good [LTE][lte] coverage from [T-Mobile HR][tmobile-hr] in most parts of Split. Sometimes, it'll drop to [3G][3g], but rarely will it be completely disconnected. Even in most parts of [Marjan Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjan) are okay. (2016-08-25)

![Good job, T-Mobile!]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/croatia-split.png)

## Estonia

### Tallinn

[Tele2][tele2-ee] goes up to [3G][3g], but I didn't find the connection wholly reliable even in Old Town. I also wasn't successful in using the city-provided wifi around the city. (2016-07-21)

![Tallinn's lower temperatures were a welcome break from the heat wave in Paris.]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/estonia-tallinn.png)

## France

### Paris

Unless you're riding the [Metro][paris-metro], [Orange][orange-fr] provides either [LTE][lte] or [3G][3g] coverage. (2016-07-19)

![Paris: the hottest day of the year and no air conditioning...]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/france-paris.jpeg)

## Germany

### Dresden

[T-Mobile][tmobile-de] was connected via [3G][3g] for most of my afternoon there. (2016-09-21)

![Beautiful weather in Saxony]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/germany-dresden.png)

### Erfurt

[LTE][lte] was spot on by [T-Mobile][tmobile-de] in this charming Thuringian city. (2016-09-25)

![Indian summer in Erfurt]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/germany-erfurt.png)

### Karlsfeld

In this suburb of Dachau, [T-Mobile][tmobile-de] (also known as Telekom.de) was connected via [LTE][LTE]. (2016-09-29)

![Continuation of summer in September]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/germany-karlsfeld.png)

### Meissen

[T-Mobile][tmobile-de] provides a solid [LTE][lte] connection even in this little Saxon town in East Germany. Sometimes, I felt like stuff wasn't loading even though my phone said it was connected, but for the most part, it worked well. (2016-09-22)

![Fall has come!]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/germany-meissen.png)

### Munich

I guess the area around Munich is where [T-Mobile][tmobile-de] likes to be called Telekom.de. Either way, [LTE][lte] was the name of the game at this bastion of Oktoberfest. (2016-09-29)

![Good start to Oktoberfest]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/germany-munich.png)

### Urfersheim

In this 170-person village, [O2][o2-de] provided [EDGE][edge] service, but luckily, my hosts had lightning fast wifi because they're located 2km outside of Illesheim, where there's a US army base.

![Small village]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/germany-urfersheim.jpg)

## Greece

### Athens

[Cosmote][cosmote] had [LTE][lte] and [3G][3g] coverage around most of Athens. I ran into very few dead spots while walking around the city, and only when the metro was deep underground was when I was connected to [EDGE][edge] or lost connection completely. (2016-08-18)

![The cellular gods smile kindly on Athens.]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/greece-athens.png)

### Kythnos

Kythnos is technically an island, not a city. I spent most of my time in Trivlaka Bay, where I had no connection whatsoever and was dependent on my hosts' wifi network. But in Merihas and Dryopida, I got [3G][3g] coverage from [Cosmote][cosmote] (2016-08-20)

![In the towns]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/greece-kythnos.png)

## Hungary

### Budapest

[T-Mobile HU][tmobile-hu] was almost always connected via [3G][3g], including in the deep metro system. I found out on 1 September that my up to [LTE][lte] speeds were temporary for the summer Olympics, so in the middle of my stay in Budapest, the data connection suddenly dropped to [EDGE][edge] speeds even though the provider information on my phone shows [3G][3g] or higher. That's lame, T-Mobile! (2016-09-02)

![Hungary does 3G]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/hungary-budapest.png)

## Iceland

### Keflavik

I didn't actually leave the airport since I had what amounted to less than an hour of layover time, but I had [LTE][lte] coverage while I was there. [NOVA][nova-is] was the local provider. (2016-07-19)

![Keflavik weather]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/iceland-keflavik.jpeg)

## Latvia

### Riga

[Tele2][tele2-lv] goes up to [3G][3g], and although there were some rare dead spots in Old Town, for the most part the speeds and connectivity seemed way better than in [Tallinn](#tallinn). I even relied on my personal hotspot on my phone to connect my tablet to the outside world since my hostel's wifi networks were not the best. (2016-07-24)

![Riga was markedly warmer than Tallinn.]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/latvia-riga.jpeg)

### Sigulda

[Tele2][tele2-lv] goes up to [3G][3g], and I was surprised at how few dead spots there were even while I was hiking around the outskirts of town. (2016-07-23)

![Sigulda is slightly cooler than Riga, possibly because of all the green space.]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/latvia-sigulda.jpeg)

## Lithuania

### Vilnius

See a pattern yet? Yes, it's [Tele2][tele2-lt] again, and they provide up to [3G][3g] speeds. I did encounter the rare dead spot while wandering around, but for the most part, it worked great. (2016-07-27)

![More hot weather in Vilnius]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/lithuania-vilnius.png)

## New Zealand

[Vodafone NZ][vodafone-nz] provided [3G][3g] in the cities, but coverage was much flakier between outposts of civilization. (2016-11-24)

![Coldest in Wanaka]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/newzealand-wanaka.png)
![Warmest in Akaroa]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/newzealand-akaroa.jpg)

## Portugal

### Lisbon

[3G][3g] was consistently available from [NOS][nos-pt] throughout the various neighborhoods of Lisbon. (2016-10-16)

![Lucky weather in Lisbon]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/portugal-lisbon.png)

### Porto

[NOS][nos-pt] does it again with reliable [3G][3g] access in Porto. (2016-10-19)

![A touch of rain in Porto]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/portugal-porto.png)

## Serbia

### Belgrade

[mt:s][mts] keeps you connected via [3G][3g] pretty consistently in city center. I was happy with the reliable service! (2016-08-29)

![Consistent 3G service in Belgrade]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/serbia-belgrade.png)

## Turkey

### Istanbul

[AVEA][avea] provides [LTE][lte] service, which was unexpected. Despite that welcome news, my connection was unreliable even when I was sitting on a bus or walking around old Istanbul. You'll probably notice that the provider keeps changing between [AVEA][avea], [Turk Telekom][turk-telekom], and [Turkcell][turkcell]. (2016-08-11)

![Argh, why did I pick August to come to Turkey?]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/turkey-istanbul.png)

## Ukraine

### Kiev

I was connected to [Vodafone][vodafone-ua]'s [3G][3g] network except in the subways where I sometimes had [EDGE][edge] network access. (2016-08-03)

![Kiev was pretty hot.]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/ukraine-kiev.png)

### Lviv

In the center of the city, [Vodafone][vodafone-ua]'s [3G][3g] network was pretty good, but I was staying south of city center, where [EDGE][edge] was more dominant. (2016-08-04)

![Also warm in Lviv but not as hot as Kiev]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/ukraine-lviv.png)

### Malyn

A small town outside of Kiev still has [EDGE][edge] network coverage through [Vodafone][vodafone-ua], so although slow, I could usually connect somehow. (2016-08-01)

![Malyn is living on the EDGE.]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/ukraine-malyn.png)

### V'yunyshche

This village has only 21 people, so what kind of service do you expect? It was fine for me, though: who needs electricity and running water 100% of the time? (2016-07-30)
