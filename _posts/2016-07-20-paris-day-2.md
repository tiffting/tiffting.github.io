Today was the day to try Sneha's food recommendations! I started at [Berthillon](http://www.berthillon.fr/glace-sorbet-berthillon/)'s take-out window. After much deliberation, I went with a very French flavor (caramel au beurre salé -> salted butter caramel), a very non-French flavor (yaourt au yuzu -> yuzu yogurt), and a huge dollop of chantilly cream (€5.10). It's very expensive for the small portion size, but the flavor quality makes up for it. There wasn't too bad of a line when I arrived at 7pm on a Wednesday.

For something savory, I visited [Boulangerie Julien](http://boulangeriejulien.com/contact.html), which has an award-winning baguette that many other customers got. I wanted something with more variety, so I lucked out when I saw the tradition rosette (€3.80), which is [saucisson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saucisson), cornichons, and butter on a baguette. I also grabbed an almond croissant (€1.90) that I later used as a decoy after [a self-guided walking tour](/detour-illegal-paris). Both were right on the mark.

Finally, I went to [Chez le Libanais](https://www.facebook.com/chezlelibanais), which is a small and narrow shop packed full of great eats, including falafel and baklava. I opted for the beef shwarma wrap (€6.00). I couldn't have asked for better. And the guys behind the counter were super nice.

I finished the wrap long before I reached the Métro station to return to Paul's flat. I only got to stay for two evenings, but it felt like home by the time I had to leave. I hope I can come visit again soon!
