I wrote some haikus about the seven ruins included in the [Acropolis](/athens-day-1) multi-site ticket. Hope you enjoy them!

## Acropolis

Crowded at the top
And not much left in situ.
Must see anyway!

## Ancient Agora

Honoring gods of
Metalworking and handicrafts,
Both outdoors and in.

## Kerameikos

Handshake with the dead.
All are equals when buried:
Can't escape our fate.

## Lyceum

Walk-and-talk schooling,
Probably more productive.
We could learn from this.

## Temple of Zeus

For the king of gods,
A spacious temple was built.
How appropriate!

## Hadrian's Library

Unexpectedly,
A turtle roams the ruins:
Crawling through the past.

## Roman Agora

Tried to supercede.
The best feature today: a
Well-conserved tower.
