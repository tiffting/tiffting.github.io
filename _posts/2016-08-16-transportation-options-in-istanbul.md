You might have been able to tell that there are many options for getting around Istanbul if you've been reading my previous posts. You're absolutely right! This post briefly describes each of them.

### Bus

Pretty much how it sounds. You can usually only enter the bus from the front by the driver so that your payment is easily verified. Scan your [Istanbulkart][ikart] at the terminal and see if you can find a seat. The fare is fixed: ₺2.30 for an initial ride or ₺1.65 for a subsequent transfer.

### Ferry

The most beautiful way to get around Istanbul, ferries vary in frequency, so make sure to check their schedules ahead of time. For instance, there's only one ferry per hour from Karaköy to Üsküdar. My favorite time to take the ferry was around sunset, and I was able to find a seat every time. The fare is fixed: ₺2.30 for an initial ride or ₺1.65 for a subsequent transfer.

### Funicular

This form of transportation goes the shortest distance (one stop). It runs between Kabataş and Taksim Square. The fare is fixed: ₺2.30 for an initial ride or ₺1.65 for a subsequent transfer.

### Marmaray Metro

The [entire line][marmaray-metro] only has five stops, and it goes under the Marmaray, which separates the European and Asian sides of Istanbul. The fare is fixed: ₺2.30 for an initial ride or ₺1.65 for a subsequent transfer.

### Metro

Istanbul has many metro lines and has ambitious plans to continue expanding the system, but it still doesn't go everywhere. Trains come pretty frequently during the day. The fare is fixed: ₺2.30 for an initial ride or ₺1.65 for a subsequent transfer.

### Metrobus

It's a bus that has a dedicated lane in the middle of the highway, so it doesn't run into traffic like regular buses. You have to tag in before you board and tag out when you before leave your destination station since the fare is calculated based on distance, much like the [Caltrain][caltrain] in SF. It's the only form of transportation in Istanbul that is not a fixed price.

### Tram

Mostly concentrated on the European side, trams run on tracks to many famous landmarks, such as the [Grand Bazaar][grand-bazaar] and [Sultanahmet][sultanahmet]. Other tram lines are the Nostalgic Tram from Taksim Square, the Moda Tram in Kadiköy, and the Aerial Tramway, which I didn't get a chance to take. The fare is fixed: ₺2.30 for an initial ride or ₺1.65 for a subsequent transfer.
