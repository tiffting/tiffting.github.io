I got to make some comforting dishes like pumpkin soup with my [Couchsurfing][cs] hosts Johanna and Costi in their industrial kitchen. (Their house used to be a cafe, so they definitely benefit from its facilities.) I also tried a few spots in the area around [Urfersheim][urfersheim].

## Coffee & drinks

### Café Nebenan

[Johanniterstraße 1, 91438 Bad Windsheim, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/rp6K3zyp2VH2)

Johanna had been curious about [Café Nebenan](http://www.cafenebenan.com/) for a while but hadn't gone inside yet. And that's what we did after our trip to the thermal bath didn't pan out.

I tried their chai (€2.20), which was okay, but I prefer my chai to be spicy.

I also got a couple of slices of [zwiebelkuchen][zwiebelkuchen] with ham (€2.50 each) to go with the [federweißer][federweisser] from [Genusswerk][genusswerk]. Mmm, so good. I want to make this so badly.

### Genusswerk

[Erkenbrechtallee 8, 91438 Bad Windsheim, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/GrLt2XXUjsk)

As we were abandoning the thermal baths because of the super long line to get in, I noticed a chalkboard outside [Genusswerk](http://www.genusswerk-franken.de/) that advertised 1L bottles of Franconian [federweißer][federweisser] for €3.50. This was so cheap compared to the bottle [I bought in Meißen](/tasting-on-meissen-and-dresden/#der-weinladen) that I paused our departure and went in to get one. It was delicious and went well with the [zwiebelkuchen][zwiebelkuchen] from [Café Nebenan][cafe-nebenan].

## Desserts & ice cream

### Bäckerei Unger

[Westheim 76, 91471 Westheim, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/SQwiNqjuZdv)

Johanna drove us to Bäckerei Unger one morning to pick up pastries for breakfast. All the labels in the display case are in German, and it wasn't abundantly clear what was in all of them. So I started asking Johanna what each pastry was and was pleasantly surprised when the proprietress answered me in really great English. That's the benefit of visiting a small town frequented by the members of the nearby US Army base.

The zimtrollen (cinnamon rolls) were airy and flaky (€1.50 each).

I was a big fan of the raspberry plundergebäck (danish, €1.30 each).

Johanna also grabbed an Oreo donut just for fun. #soamerican

## Grocery stores & farmer's markets

### Edeka

[Oberntiefer Str. 7B, 91438 Bad Windsheim, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/jrBtwpjzmKv)

I never actually stepped into one, but from what I heard, [Edeka](https://www.edeka.de) sounds like a German [Whole Foods](http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com). They sell local goods, such as this apple juice pressed from local fruits and without added sugar. I couldn't stop drinking this.

Costi also shared some locally brewed pilsner with me. It tasted refreshing!

## Fränkisches Freilandmuseum

[Eisweiherweg 1, 91438 Bad Windsheim, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/uLPs38X6a6D2)

Not only did I explore the architecture at the [Freilandmuseum](/sights-of-urfersheim/#frnkisches-freilandmuseum), but I also brought different varieties of apples home from the many trees on the property.

Johanna's mom Petra also bought two kinds of cured sausages and some delicious bread so that we could enjoy brotzeit ("bread time") that evening. I love brotzeit!
