Paul, one of my [TAMS][tams] classmates, is currently assigned to [Palantir][palantir]'s Paris office, so I made an exception to visit this city despite having been here a few times already. His apartment is in Le Marais in the 4th arrondissement.

We met up for lunch at [Honor Cafe][honor], which is near his office. It's owned by a couple of Australians who know their coffee, and they make delicious sandwiches. I ended up with their smoke trout sandwich (€8.50) and cold-brew coffee (€5), which comes in a flash-like glass bottle.

After Paul was done with work and a workout, we enjoyed a bottle of Champagne before walking over to [Au Pied de Fouet][aupieddefouet]'s 4th arr. location for a bottle of red from Côtes du Rhône (€17), goose rillete (€6.50), escargot (€8), beef burger (€16.50), and duck confit (€16.50). As I'd experienced previously at their original location, the food was delicious and very French, which was just what I was looking for.

For our post-dinner amusement, we went to Sacre Coeur at midnight. Many people gathered on the steps for the full moon. We also saw some interesting wall art as we walked down the steps from the basilica.

Finally, we rode the city bikes back to the 4th arr. and passed by some random art galleries around Place des Vosges. This particular sculpture caught my eye.
