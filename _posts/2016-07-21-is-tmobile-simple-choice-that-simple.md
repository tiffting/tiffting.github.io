title: Is T-Mobile's Simple Choice plan that simple?
categories: connectivity
---
If you have an unlocked [GSM][gsm] phone, you can easily avoid buying and carrying around a bunch of SIM cards with you especially if you're traveling to a bunch of different countries by subscribing to any [T-Mobile Simple Choice plan][tmobile-plans]. They include unlimited data and SMS, and phone calls are 20 cents per minute. (I use my [Google Voice][google-voice] number to get around that.) Check out the [full list of supported countries][tmobile-countries], but I'm going to be keeping a running tally of how well the service really performs in each city I visit.

- [Keflavik, Iceland](#keflavi-iceland)
- [Paris, France](#paris-france)
- [Tallinn, Estonia](#tallinn-estonia)

## Keflavik, Iceland

I didn't actually leave the airport since I had what amounted to less than an hour of layover time, but I had LTE coverage while I was there. NOVA was the local provider. (2016-07-19)

## Paris, France

Unless you're riding the [Metro][paris-metro], [Orange][orange-fr] provides either LTE or 3G coverage. (2016-07-19)

## Tallinn, Estonia

[Tele2][tele2-ee] goes up to 3G, but I didn't find the connection wholly reliable even in Old Town. I also wasn't successful in using the city-provided wifi around the city. (2016-07-21)
