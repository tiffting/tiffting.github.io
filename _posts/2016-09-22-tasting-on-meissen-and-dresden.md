With my amazing [Couchsurfing][cs] hosts Nathalia and Marcel, I was able to try some delicious vegan food, including a vegan spin on a traditional German dinner. It was also [federweißer][federweisser] season, so I tried some from the Saxony region.

## Coffee & drinks

### Der Weinladen

[Elbstraße 11, 01662 Meißen, Germany](https://maps.google.com/?q=Der%20Weinladen%2C%20Elbstra%C3%9Fe%2011%2C%2001662%20Mei%C3%9Fen%2C%20Germany&ftid=0x4709d5f93371fe11:0x2c8d822abc19fb7&hl=en-US&gl=us)

My hosts let me borrow a bike to visit the old town, and I noticed a wine shop selling Saxony [federweißer][federweisser] for €8.50 for 1L. I couldn't read any German, but I found out later that they were supposed to charge €10 if I wanted to drink it at the shop vs. €8.50 for takeaway. I guess the shopkeep didn't speak enough English to tell me the difference and ask me for the extra €1.50 when I requested a wine glass to drink it at a table just outside.

To be honest when I initially began the transaction, I thought I would take the bottle home to share with my hosts. But after the shopkeep swiped my credit card, I remembered that there wasn't a great place to secure the bottle or prevent any bumps in the road from causing an explosion. So I had to drink the entire bottle to prevent disaster.

There was a little stand in the square nearby selling rostbratwurst for €2, so I got one to accompany my drink. Although the traditional food to have with [federweißer][federweisser] is onion cake ([zweibelkuchen][zeiwbelkuchen]), the rostbratwurst hit the spot.

## Desserts & ice cream

### Eiscafe Venezia

[Heinrichspl. 5, 01662 Meißen, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/ke5jhGfFPG12)

This ice cream shop is Nathalia's favorite one in Meißen. It's right in the little square near [Der Weinladen][weinladen]. Sampling doesn't seem to be commonplace in Germany, but I did convince the scooper to give me a taste of the blackberry sorbet. It had too many large seeds in it for me to buy it. Instead, I got scoops of the fig sorbet and mango lassi ice cream (€1.20 per scoop). They tasted well-made, but there didn't seem to be any particularly German flavors.

### Café V-cake

[Rothenburger Str. 14, 01099 Dresden, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/NLHJXdkgkXT2)

Nathalia's favorite cafe in Dresden is [V-cake](https://m.facebook.com/cafe.vcake). Surprise: everything is vegan! And the interior is adorable.

Good thing Nathalia arrived early: she reserved the last two slices of raspberry cream cake (€3.70). Marcel ordered a slice of donauwelle (€3.30) and a pot of coffee (€3.10). Nathalia got a latte macchiato (€2.50) with a spoonful of nutella (€0.30). I loved the raspberry cream cake! I wonder if I can figure out how they made it.

## Grocery stores & homemade food

### REWE

[15, Neumarkt 9, 01662 Meißen, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/PETrrCbNAqM2)

I love grocery stores because they give a glimpse into what locals actually eat. [REWE](https://www.rewe.de/) is no exception. Thanks to them, I got to try [reibekuchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reibekuchen) (€1.29), which I could microwave quickly for breakfast.

Nathalia is a fan of [marzipan kartoffeln](http://www.food.com/recipe/marzipankartoffeln-german-marzipan-potatoes-469663) (€0.99), but I thought the ones from the store were too sweet to finish in one go. When I make my own, I'll be toning down the sugar content.

I was afraid I wouldn't get to try any beer from Meissen Schwerter before leaving the area, but I found a 0.5L bottle of their pilsner for €0.77 at a location in Dresden.

### Nathalia & Marcel's kitchen

[Meißen, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/XuV3eoscRcL2)

Not only did Marcel make tasty vegan pizza and his famous cauliflower soup, but he also whipped up a delicious version of German meatballs (made of tofu), mashed potatoes, and sauerkraut. Their kitchen is so inspiring, and I hope I can incorporate more vegan meals into my diet after I get home.

## Restaurants

### Café & Konditorei Schreiber

[Elbstraße 31, 01662 Meißen, Germany](https://maps.google.com/?q=Caf%C3%A9%20%26%20Konditorei%20Schreiber%20Inh.%20Uwe%20Schreiber%2C%20Elbstra%C3%9Fe%2031%2C%2001662%20Mei%C3%9Fen%2C%20Germany&ftid=0x4709d5e3703d25f3:0xe840a3aae684af7e&hl=en-US&gl=us)

I didn't find [zweibelkuchen][zweibelkuchen] until hours after I'd finished my bottle of [federweißer][federweisser] at [Scheiber](http://www.konditorei-cafe-schreiber.de/Cafs.439/). The shopkeep wanted to make sure I knew it was onion cake when I asked for a slice (€1.50/slice for takeaway), and the Saxon apple tort (€1.45/slice for takeaway) was also yummy. I recommend throwing them in the microwave for 15 seconds to make it taste more like freshly made pie.
