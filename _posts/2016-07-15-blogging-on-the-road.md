Being [limited to 7kg of stuff][permalink-packing-list], I opted not to bring my laptop (1.82kg with case) and instead threw down the money to buy a tablet (800g with case and keyboard). But how would I publish any musings about my travels without a laptop? I knew I wanted to use [Github][github], but I wasn't sure how well it works with tablets.

So after a bit of searching online and trial and error, I set up [Github Pages][github-pages] with [Jekyll][jekyll] from my laptop. ([This Github documentation][github-pages-with-jekyll] has more details about how to use the two of them together.)

Then I found [Editorial][editorial] (pay $9.99 once and get it both on iPhone and iPad), which is a [Markdown][markdown] editor for iOS that supports workflows to automate repetitive tasks like interacting with Github. [This workflow][hardscrabble] does just that, and it was pretty simple to implement.
