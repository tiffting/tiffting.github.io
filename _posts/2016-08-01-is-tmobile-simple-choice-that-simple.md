If you have an unlocked [GSM][gsm] phone, you can easily avoid buying and carrying around a bunch of SIM cards with you especially if you're traveling to a bunch of different countries by subscribing to any [T-Mobile Simple Choice plan][tmobile-plans]. They include unlimited data and SMS, and phone calls are 20 cents per minute. (I use my [Google Voice][google-voice] number to get around that.) Check out the [full list of supported countries][tmobile-countries], but I'm going to be keeping a running tally of how well the service really performs in each city I visit.

## Estonia

### Tallinn

[Tele2][tele2-ee] goes up to 3G, but I didn't find the connection wholly reliable even in Old Town. I also wasn't successful in using the city-provided wifi around the city. (2016-07-21)

## France

### Paris

Unless you're riding the [Metro][paris-metro], [Orange][orange-fr] provides either LTE or 3G coverage. (2016-07-19)

## Iceland

### Keflavik

I didn't actually leave the airport since I had what amounted to less than an hour of layover time, but I had LTE coverage while I was there. [NOVA][nova-is] was the local provider. (2016-07-19)

## Latvia

### Riga

[Tele2][tele2-lv] goes up to 3G, and although there were some rare dead spots in Old Town, for the most part the speeds and connectivity seemed way better than in [Tallinn](#tallinn). I even relied on my personal hotspot on my phone to connect my tablet to the outside world since my hostel's wifi networks were not the best. (2016-07-24)

![Riga was markedly warmer than Tallinn.]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/latvia-riga.jpeg)

### Sigulda

[Tele2][tele2-lv] goes up to 3G, and I was surprised at how few dead spots there were even while I was hiking around the outskirts of town. (2016-07-23)

![Sigulda is slightly cooler than Riga, possibly because of all the green space.]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/latvia-sigulda.jpeg)

## Lithuania

### Vilnius

See a pattern yet? Yes, it's [Tele2][tele2-lt] again, and they provide up to 3G speeds. I did encounter the rare dead spot while wandering around, but for the most part, it worked great. (2016-07-27)

## Ukraine

### Kiev

I was connected to [Vodafone][vodafone-ua]'s 3G network except in the subways where I sometimes had EDGE network access. (2016-08-03)

![Kiev was pretty hot.]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/ukraine-kiev.png)

### Malyn

A small town outside of Kiev still has EDGE network coverage through [Vodafone][vodafone-ua], so although slow, I could usually connect somehow. (2016-08-01)

![Malyn is living on the EDGE.]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tmobile/ukraine-malyn.png)

### V'yunyshche

This village has only 21 people, so what kind of service do you expect? It was fine for me, though: who needs electricity and running water 100% of the time? (2016-07-30)
