title: Is T-Mobile's Simple Choice plan that simple?
categories: connectivity

If you have an unlocked [GSM][gsm] phone, you can easily avoid buying and carrying around a bunch of SIM cards with you especially if you're traveling to a bunch of different countries by subscribing to any [T-Mobile Simple Choice plan][tmobile-plans]. I'm going to be keeping a running tally of how well the service performs in each city I visit.

Jump directly to a city:

- [Keflavik, Iceland](#keflavi-iceland)
- [Paris, France](#paris-france)

## Keflavik, Iceland

I didn't actually leave the airport since I had what amounted to less than an hour of layover time, but I had LTE coverage while I was there. NOVA was the local provider:

## Paris, France

Unless you're riding the [Metro][paris-metro], Orange provides either LTE or 3G coverage.
