After my satisfying lunch at [Mr. Biskvits](http://mr.biskvits.lv/en#edienkarte), I went back up to [Rai≈Üa Park](https://goo.gl/maps/1Kyw9ibU2Mm), although this time, I walked along the west side and got to see some of the mad landscaping skills of Siguldans.

On the sidewalk, I noticed the mark of Sigulda again. It seems so adorable yet reminds me a bit of crossbones.

During this hike, I saw another unfamiliar flower and many mushrooms sprouting from the moist earth.

The first sight I reached on the legends route is called [Painter's Hill or Paradise Hill](http://www.tourism.sigulda.lv/paradise-hill---painter-s-hill/). I am not sure which name I prefer, but both are appropriate for the gorgeous view of the [Turaida Medieval Castle](http://www.tourism.sigulda.lv/turaida-medieval-castle/) and the Gauja River,  which you can admire from a hollowed oak trunk swing. I got too impatient when I was trying to get off the swing and stuck my feet in the ground. However, because the trunk is so heavy, it won: I fell forward out of the swing onto my hands and knees. Luckily, I only scraped up only one of my knees and used some water from my bottle to wipe it off.

The next stop was [Raven's Ravine and Cave][ravens-cave]. It wasn't as impressive as [Gutman's Cave][gutmans-cave], but this whole route could have been more enjoyable had the [Sigulda Tourism Information Center](http://www.tourism.sigulda.lv) bothered to put up signs explaining the legends of these locations.

The trail I tried to take to see [Peter's Cave][peters-cave] was closed because of a landslide, so I decided to visit the [Satsele Castle Mound](http://www.tourism.sigulda.lv/satesele-castle-mound/) first. Despite my best efforts, I found the overlook but not the castle mound itself. Maybe I didn't know what I was looking for: people in the Baltics like to exaggerate a bit, like calling a 350m hill a mountain. So if they're calling this a mound, who knows how small it would have looked to me?

On the longer way to [Peter's Cave][peters-cave], I walked by a nice wooden swing standing in the middle of a field.

[Peter's Cave][peters-cave] was [yonic](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=yonic)-looking, and it had the now-familiar cave graffiti I'd seen previously at [Gutman's Cave][gutmans-cave] and [Raven's Cave][ravens-cave].

It was time to head back to the city and catch the afternoon train to Riga. Along the way, I walked down a residential street and saw a small house, perhaps used as additional storage space in someone's backyard.

![It's a beautiful day.]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2016/07/26/sigulda-day-trip-legends-route/city-house.jpeg)

Many statues dot the city, and [one of them](http://www.tourism.sigulda.lv/monument-to-rudolfs-blaumanis/) resembled a Muppet.

![He should start talking anytime now.]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2016/07/26/sigulda-day-trip-legends-route/city-muppet.jpeg)

By the train station, there's a tower that's used as an art gallery, and the train station itself looked nice against the sky.

All in all, Sigulda was worth a detour from Riga. My feet were sore from hiking around for hours, but it was nice to get out of the big city and into some nature.
