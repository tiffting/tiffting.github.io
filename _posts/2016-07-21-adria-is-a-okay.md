[Adria Airways][adria-airways] is the largest airline in Slovenia. It's a member of the [Star Alliance](http://www.staralliance.com/en/member-airlines), so I used my United loyalty program to accumulate points for my flight. My one-way ticket cost US$140 from Paris to Tallinn.

The check-in counter line went quickly, and they didn't actually weigh my carry-on luggage despite their [8kg limit](https://www.adria.si/en/information/baggage/baggage-allowances-and-fees/). For the boarding process, we had to get on an airport bus to get to the small, regional plane we'd be taking for our flight.

I could still fit my 25L backpack in the overhead bin of the small plane. But neither entertainment nor power adapters were available. But for a less-than-three-hour flight, it was fine with me!
