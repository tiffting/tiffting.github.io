## Hotels: 2

I define hotels as places I paid for to stay in my own room. I've lumped in the one [Airbnb][airbnb] property I stayed in under this category.

## Hostels: 5

This type of accommodation is defined as places I paid for and shared rooms with others. I stayed in both female-only and mixed dorms in various hostels.

## Couchsurfing: 16

You're not allowed to pay your hosts as a [CS][cs] guest. The vast majority of my hosts were amazing people whom I'm glad to have met and continue to keep in touch with. As with all other accommodation types, sometimes you do encounter a bad egg, but that's just life. I plan to continue participating in the community even after this trip ends.
