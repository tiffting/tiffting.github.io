title: Which birth control methods are travel friendly?
---
Many questions arise when you start planning a really long trip. As a woman, I started wondering which birth control methods are friendlier for someone on the go. (Any methods that I don't mention are ones I have no experience with but ruled out because of questionable effectiveness, bulk, or frequency of having to fuss with it.) Don't get me wrong: I'm using birth control for its secondary benefit, which is controlling my menstrual cycle. This is a pretty cool superpower when you need to limit the quantity of feminine hygiene products you have on you.

## The pill

- Status: I used this method in the past.
- Thoughts: I think I'm a pretty responsible person, but having to remember to take a pill every day is too much when preventing pregnancy is on the line. I **would not** recommend this method whether you're traveling or not.

## Depo-Provera

- Status: I used this method in the past.
- Thoughts: Long-term use of the shot puts women at higher risk of getting osteoporosis. Having to give myself a shot or visit a nurse to give me a shot every three months is inconvenient, especially if I'm on the road. I **would not** recommend this method, especially if you're traveling.

## Nuvaring

- Status: I currently use this method.
- Thoughts: I have repeating to-dos that remind me of when to remove and replace my Nuvaring (on a four-week cycle). This method has worked well for me. It also releases a lower dose of hormones than most other methods, which I like. I **would** recommend this method if you're comfortable with interacting with your lady bits every once in a while **and** you're able to keep them refrigerated while on the road if you're gone for more than four months. (I can't speak to how easy it is to get them while traveling.)

## Implant

- Status: I've considered using this method.
- Thoughts: A method that doesn't need any messing around with for three years or more sounds great! But the most common complaint is that in the first six to twelve months, you might have irregular bleeding. Given that I'm traveling for less than a year (I think), I think that would be pretty annoying. Maybe I'll try this method after I return home.

## IUD

- Status: I've considered using this method.
- Thoughts: Protection for anywhere between three and twelve years? That's pretty cool! But like the implant, a common complaint is irregular bleeding in the first few months. This is another method I'll consider trying after I return home from this particular trip.
