I hadn't originally planned to visit [Český Krumlov][cesky-krumlov] since I had heard its popularity with tourists is second only to [Prague][prague]. But since my family happened to be going there for a day and a half and it is only a 30-minute bus ride from [České Budějovice][ceske-budejovice], I overcame momentum and got a €3 round-trip ticket on a [RegioJet][regiojet] bus and took a day-trip there.

It turned out that I was on the same bus as my family was taking from [Prague][prague] to [Český Krumlov][cesky-krumlov], so I was surprised when I heard my dad call my Chinese name when I got on the bus. What a small world we live in! Here's what we got to see, other than the [street art](/street-art-of-cesky-krumlov) we found.

## Český Krumlov Castle

[Zámek 59, 381 01 Český Krumlov, Czech Republic](https://goo.gl/maps/GHdXjaEn42m)

This [castle](https://www.zamek-ceskykrumlov.eu/en) is the jewel of Český Krumlov, but the novelty quickly wore off for me since its colorful façade results from paint rather than use of different materials. But it is still a nice postcard image.

I enjoyed hanging out near the Cloak Bridge, which is on the western side of the Upper Castle. Not only can you admire its monumental arcade structure, but you can also watch rowers trying to get their rafts over the last weir in Krumlov.

### Admission and hours

I didn't actually enter the castle, so I'm not sure what the hours are, but I heard that you can walk through it at no charge. If you want to take a tour, to go into the museums, or to climb the tower, then you'll have to worry about admission fees.

### Getting there and back

It's just north of the center of the city, so you walk there easily. Or you can just see it from many different parts of the city.

## Křížový Vrch

[Český Krumlov, Czech Republic](https://goo.gl/maps/tdJAYQSUaTJ2)

Known as Cross Hill in English, the [USE-IT][use-it] map recommended it for a nice view of the city without the usual hordes. But it turned out to be an arduous, steep path through a residential area, then up a footpath carved through tall grass by other unsuspecting travelers. Anticlimactically, the view was blocked by trees, the church on the hill was abandoned, and there was trash strewn everywhere by vagrants.

### Admission and hours

It's free except for all that sweat you're going to produce to get up there. You can go anytime, but I don't recommend it.

### Getting there and back

It takes about 30 minutes to walk there from the center of town. There's not another alternative way to get there since you'll spend a good 10 minutes just trekking through tall grass.

## Městský Park

[Český Krumlov, Czech Republic](https://goo.gl/maps/kW1zJ8NwtND2)

The city park is a nice spot to get away from the throngs of tourists crowding the center. We hung out at a gazebo at the north part of the park.

### Admission and hours

No admission fee, but I'm not sure what the hours are. I seem to recall a gate, so it probably closes at night.

### Getting there and back

This park is southeast of city center, and it's just a five minute walk from the [main square](#nmst-svornosti).

## Minorite Monastery

[Klášterní 50, 381 01 Český Krumlov, Czech Republic](https://goo.gl/maps/A9F9H9x2pJn)

The [monastery](http://www.ceskykrumlov.com/en/what-to-see/latran/minorite-monastery/) from the 14th century has been restored to its pre-communist state, thanks to some money finally being made available to fix it up in 2010. Mom and I visited the gardens and were charmed by the variety of fruits and vegetables were growing there. We even picked a decent quantity of fresh raspberries to take back to Dad and Alex to try.

### Admission and hours

There's no admission fee to visit the gardens, but I did see something about buying tickets to visit the museum inside the monastery itself.

### Getting there and back

It's located east of the [castle](#esk-krumlov-castle), just north of city center. Walking there is the easiest way to get there.


## Náměstí Svornosti

[Nám. Svornosti, 381 01 Český Krumlov, Czech Republic](https://goo.gl/maps/mtxYZWhkkpH2)

The town square is surrounded with beautiful historic buildings, and you can find the tourist information center here, too.

There's also a large fountain that Dad and I were curious about, and I found out that it was built to commemorate the ending of the plague. The statues are of anti-plague saints, and in the center is a plague column.

### Admission and hours

It's free and open all the time!

### Getting there and back

The square is smack dab in the center. Use your two feet!

## Vltava River

[Český Krumlov, Czech Republic](https://goo.gl/maps/MDMMHrk3VoJ2)

Walking along the banks of the [Vltava River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vltava) is a great way to see the city. Dad even recalled that he learned about this river in school, and it runs past [Prague][prague] and [Český Krumlov][cesky-krumlov].

<img src="/images/2016/09/16/sights-of-cesky-krumlov/vltava-cliff.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Nature along the river" title="Nature along the river"/>

You can also get a nice view of the buildings by the river.

### Admission and hours

No fee, and no time limit.

### Getting there and back

Mom and I walked along Náplavka Street, which is just north of city center and east of the [monastery](#minorite-monastery). You'll pass by [Eggenberg](http://www.eggenberg.cz/index.php?page=home&lang=en), which is [Český Krumlov][cesky-krumlov]'s local brewery.
