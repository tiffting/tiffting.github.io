The most visited ruin of Athens, the [Acropolis][acropolis] was surprisingly not my favorite place to visit out of the seven ruins on the [multi-site pass](/athens-day-1). But because of its historical significance, I would still recommend paying your respects if you're in Athens.

The [Theater of Dionysus][theater-dionysus] was the first thing I encountered on the way up to the [Acropolis][acropolis]. It's fairly intact given its age, and you can see different seat designs, probably to reflect how much audience members paid for their tickets.

Given its elevation, there's a great view of Athens from the [Acropolis][acropolis].

Most of the interesting details of the [Parthenon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenon) now live at the [Acropolis Museum](/trip-to-athens), but seeing the building in person remains awe-inspiring.

A tidy pile of column capitals sat around near the [Parthenon][parthenon].

The [Erechtheion][erechtheion] must have been Poseidon's consolation prize since he [lost the contest](http://www.paleothea.com/Myths/Athens.html) for becoming the city's patron by presenting the first king of Athens a well of salty ocean water rather than Athena's gift of the olive tree.

I also got a preview from up high of my next destination: the [Ancient Agora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Agora_of_Athens).
