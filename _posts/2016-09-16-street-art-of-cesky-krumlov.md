Thanks to [Hotel Bohemia](http://bohemia.restaurant), I had a helpful map from [USE-IT](http://use-it.cz/en/) that led me to [Ukradená Galerie](http://ukradenagalerie.cz), whose first outdoor street art installment started in [Český Krumlov][cesky-krumlov]. So yeah, I dragged my family during my day-trip to see graffiti. I think they enjoyed it! We saw some other street art later in the day elsewhere, too.
