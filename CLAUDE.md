2. Process documentation
3. Before/after comparisons
4. Technical details
5. Stakeholder feedback
6. Results/metrics

## Technical Notes
- All templates use inline CSS for portability

- Emoji updates for better contrast against colored backgrounds
- Name corrections throughout all templates
- Placeholders use hex codes (not CSS variables) for visibility

## Next Steps for Claude Code

2. Convert to Jekyll layouts (_layouts directory)
3. Add actual images to replace placeholders
4. Create blog posts using the post template
5. Set up GitHub Pages or hosting
6. Populate with real project screenshots and artifacts
