## Challenge

Long-time comedy website needed modernization, but stakeholders were resistant to change. Required data-driven approach and strategic communication.

## Process

*(Iteratively add details as you develop content)*

1. Data analysis of current site performance
2. Rapid prototyping with v0
3. Refinement with Claude Code
4. Stakeholder presentation via Gamma

## Solution

Modern, responsive website with improved user experience and clear data-backed reasoning for all changes.
