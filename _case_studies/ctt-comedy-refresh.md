## Challenge

A long-established comedy venue needed a website refresh, but faced significant organizational resistance:

- **Legacy attachment** - "The current site has worked for years, why change it?"
- **Risk aversion** - Fear that changes would confuse existing customers
- **Lack of data** - No analytics to prove current site had issues
- **Stakeholder skepticism** - Multiple decision-makers with different priorities

The challenge wasn't just redesigning a website - it was building consensus for change through empathy and evidence.

## Approach

### Week 4: Research & Analysis
I started by understanding the current state through data:
- Analyzed Google Analytics (bounce rates, user flows, mobile vs desktop traffic)
- Conducted heuristic evaluation of UX pain points
- Reviewed customer feedback and support tickets
- Identified mobile usability issues (60% of traffic on mobile, but site not responsive)

### Week 5-6: Rapid Prototyping with v0
Instead of wireframes, I created high-fidelity interactive prototypes:
- **Visual communication** - Stakeholders could see and interact with the new design
- **Rapid iteration** - Generated multiple design directions in hours, not days
- **Mobile-first approach** - Ensured responsive design from the start

### Week 7: Refinement with Claude Code
Took v0 prototypes into production-quality code:
- Cleaned up component structure for maintainability
- Optimized performance (image loading, CSS)
- Ensured accessibility compliance (WCAG AA)
- Deployed demo site for stakeholder testing

### Week 8: Strategic Presentation
Created a Gamma presentation to build stakeholder buy-in:
- **Led with data** - Showed analytics proving mobile usability issues
- **Addressed concerns** - Acknowledged legacy value while demonstrating improvements
- **Visual comparisons** - Before/after mockups for key user journeys
- **Risk mitigation** - Proposed phased rollout plan

## Solution

The new website delivers measurable improvements:

### User Experience Wins
- **Responsive design** - Works seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Simplified navigation** - Reduced clicks to purchase tickets
- **Improved accessibility** - Color contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Faster load times** - Optimized images and modern web standards

### Technical Implementation
- **Modern tech stack** - Built with maintainability in mind
- **Performance optimized** - Lazy loading, code splitting
- **SEO improvements** - Proper semantic HTML, meta tags
- **Analytics integration** - Set up for data-driven iteration

## Key Learnings

### Change Management
- **Data builds credibility** - Analytics made the case more compelling than opinions
- **Empathy matters** - Acknowledged stakeholder concerns instead of dismissing them
- **Show, don't tell** - Interactive prototypes communicate better than descriptions
- **Strategic framing** - Positioned redesign as risk mitigation, not just aesthetics

### Tool Selection
- **v0 for speed** - Rapid visual prototyping gets stakeholder feedback early
- **Claude Code for quality** - Production refinement ensures maintainable code
- **Gamma for persuasion** - Professional presentations build executive confidence

### Product Strategy
- **Phased rollout reduces risk** - Propose iterative changes instead of "big bang" launch
- **Test with real users** - Demo site allowed stakeholder hands-on evaluation
- **Measure everything** - Set up analytics before launch to prove impact

## Outcome

While the full launch is still in progress, the demo site and presentation successfully shifted stakeholder sentiment from resistance to cautious optimism. The project demonstrates how combining technical execution with strategic communication can overcome organizational inertia.
