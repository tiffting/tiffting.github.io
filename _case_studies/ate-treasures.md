## Challenge

Design a plant-based restaurant concept that bridges cultures and serves both locals and tourists in Osaka's Nishinari Ward.

## Process

*(Iteratively add details as you develop content)*

1. Market opportunity identification (Nishinari Ward demographics)
2. Cross-cultural naming (八寶 → "Ate Treasures" → 吃寶了)
3. Business model design (pre-constructed + Chipotle-style customization)
4. Menu concept development

## Linguistic Bridge

The name "Ate Treasures" creates a trilingual play:
- **八寶** (Chinese): Eight Treasures (traditional dish)
- **Ate Treasures** (English): Past tense of "eat" + valuable food
- **吃寶了** (Mandarin): "Ate the treasure!" (discovered during meditation retreat)

## Solution

Plant-based restaurant combining pre-constructed menu items with customizable options, targeting both local residents and international tourists.

## Key Learnings

- Cross-cultural design requires linguistic and cultural sensitivity
- AI collaboration (ChatGPT) accelerates concept iteration
- Market opportunity lies at the intersection of trends (plant-based + tourism)
