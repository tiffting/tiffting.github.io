## Challenge

Comedy venues struggle with multi-channel ticket sales (in-person, online, phone) leading to overselling, manual spreadsheet tracking, and revenue loss.

## Process

*(Iteratively add details as you develop content)*

1. User research with venue managers
2. Architecture design with Supabase schema
3. Square API integration for inventory
4. Mobile-optimized box office UI

## Solution

Full-stack platform that syncs capacity across all sales channels in real-time, automates Square inventory updates, and provides mobile-optimized interfaces.

## Key Learnings

- Facebook/Google event APIs don't support capacity synchronization
- Tool selection: v0 for rapid prototyping, Claude Code for production refinement
- Stakeholder validation through weekly demos builds trust in AI-assisted development

*(Add iteratively: Screenshots, user feedback, metrics)*
