## Technical Product Translator

I'm Tiff Ting, a methodical problem-solver who translates complex technical requirements into user-centered solutions for mission-driven organizations.

### What I Do

I specialize in:
- **Product strategy and execution**: Translating technical complexity into clear solutions
- **User research and synthesis**: Discovering real constraints, not just stated preferences
- **Cross-industry pattern recognition**: Applying learnings across domains (healthcare, arts, nonprofit, SaaS)
- **Systems design**: Balancing time, budget, business objectives, and user needs

I work with organizations where **mission matters** and technical challenges require both strategic thinking and hands-on execution.

### Current Focus

Building **[Capisara](https://capisara.com/)**, a unified box office management platform for live event venues. I'm also contributing pro bono to **[Music Declares Emergency's AMPLIFY program](https://www.musicdeclares.net/us/campaigns/mde-us-amplify-program)**, connecting touring artists with grassroots climate organizations.

### Recent Learning

In 2025, I completed two intensive, 12-week generative AI programs that deepened my technical capabilities:

- **[Voiz.AI Reskilling Program](https://www.voizai.com/)**: Product management and development with AI tools, including the CTT Comedy website redesign and Ate Treasures restaurant concept
- **[Amplify for Animals](https://amplifyforanimals.org/)**: Strategic AI applications for animal advocacy organizations

These programs strengthened my ability to work with AI as a thought partner while maintaining critical evaluation of its outputs and limitations.

### Personality

Empathetic • Curious • Methodical • Open-minded • Humble

### Languages

- **Native**: English
- **Conversational**: Mandarin Chinese
- **Learning**: Japanese
- **Basic**: Spanish

## Travel & Food Archive

From July 2016 through September 2017, I took a solo, round-the-world trip, followed by a nomadic lifestyle in Taiwan. This blog started as a travel journal documenting those experiences.

You can explore over a hundred posts about food, local culture, and off-the-beaten-path adventures in the [blog archive](/blog).

I love all things related to food, hanging out with locals, and going off the beaten path.
