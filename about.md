Hey, there: I'm Tiff Ting. As of July 18, 2016, I started a round-the-world trip, and I'm not exactly sure when I'm returning home to San Francisco, CA. I hope sharing my experiences is valuable, and not just to future me who needs a reminder of past me.

## More info

I love all things related to food, so you'll hear a lot about that. I also enjoy hanging out with locals and going off the beaten path.

My native language is English, and I am conversational in Mandarin Chinese. My Japanese skills are very basic, and my Spanish is worse. I warn you that I have terrible French pronunciation.
