Hey, there: I'm Tiff Ting. From July 2016 through September 2017, I took a solo, round-the-world trip. I continued my nomadic lifestyle in Taiwan. I hope sharing my experiences is valuable, and not just to future me who needs a reminder of past me.

## More info

I love all things related to food, so you'll hear a lot about that. I also enjoy hanging out with locals and going off the beaten path.

My native language is English, and I am conversational in Mandarin Chinese. My Japanese skills are very basic, and my Spanish is worse. I warn you that I have terrible French pronunciation.
